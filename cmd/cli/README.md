quorum -peername chux0519_peer -listen /ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/7002  -apilisten :8002 -peer /ip4/167.114.61.179/tcp/10666/p2p/16Uiu2HAmE7TYnrYtC6tAsWvz4EUGQke1wsdrkw2kt8GFv6brfHFw  -debug true

## Start

Just run rumcli.

The rumcli use serveral commands to interact with the API server.

In rumcli, press `Space` to bring up the command prompt, then

- `/connect` connect to an API server, for example, run 

    > /connect 127.0.0.1:8002

    It will connect to your API server, after that, you will see the status of your server and so on.

- `/join` join into a group, for example, run

    > /join @/home/user/seed.json

     It will use the `/home/user/seed.json` and try to join that group. 
     
     You can use plain text without the `@` prefix as well, like 
    > /join $plain-json-text

- `/send` to send content to group, for example, run

    > /send hello, world

    It will send "hello, world" to current group.

- `/group.create` to new a group, for example, run

    > /group.create mygroup1
    
    It will create a group, and save the seed to your /tmp/xxxx

- `/group.leave` to leave a group

- `/group.delete` to delete a group (only group owner can do this)
